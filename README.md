# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my [Bootstrap Portfolio](https://cl-lee.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/). As the names suggests, the webpage is made using Bootstrap (v4.3.1). Please click on the following URL to visit the webpage: https://cl-lee.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/.

I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp for web development, this Portfolio will be updated to showcase my future works and projects.

## Site layout

The Portfolio webpage is divided into 5 major sections: 
1. Navigation Bar
2. Hero
3. Work
4. About me
5. Contact

## Viewing the Portfolio

    * Upon landing on the web page, visitors can click on the corresponding links in the Navigation bar to visit the "Work", "About me" and "Contact" sections.
