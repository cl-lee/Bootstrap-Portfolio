# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my [Bootstrap Portfolio](https://cl-lee.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/), the webpage is made using Bootstrap (v4.3.1) as the name suggests. Please click on the following URL to visit the webpage: https://cl-lee.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/.

I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp for web development, this Portfolio will be updated to showcase my future works and projects.

## Site layout

The Portfolio webpage is divided into 5 major sections: 
1. The navigation bar
2. The hero section
3. The work section
4. Section about me, and skills that I will acquire in the bootcamp
5. The contact section
